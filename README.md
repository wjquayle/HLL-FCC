# HLL-FCC
Hell Let Loose artillery calculator for the Elgato Stream Deck. This Fire Control Center will allow ranges to be entered in and to be converted to elevation readings to be used in-game. 

Originally, I envisioned entering in each distance by digit, dedicating 10 entire buttons to just the one number. However, a simpler and perhaps more efficient method is to enter the program at a set distance and have each button add/remove a set amount of distance; =/- 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 500 and then a dedicated readout for the azimuth and swapping factions
